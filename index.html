 <h2>How Women Impacted the 1800s in Four Ways</h2>   
   <br> <p>Historians have offered the viewpoints for those in politics and in battle, causing female contributions to be marginalized by these accounts. <b>Here are the top four impacts women had during the 1800s:</b></p>
    <br><ol>
    <li><b>Secret Soldiers: </b><p1> Due to strict genderroles in the 1800s, men were expected to die while women were expected to stay home. However, according to DeAnne Blanton, some women refused to stay in their socially madiated place as housewives, because the war was on their doorstep <a href="https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1993/spring/women-in-the-civil-war-3.html" style="color: #DCE2DF" target="_blank">(DeAnna Blanton)</a>. They chopped off their hair and followed their male counterparts onto the battlefield as secret soldiers.</p1></li><br>
        <li><b>Economy Boosters: </b><p1> The women who stayed home had plenty of things to take care, all while proving they could do so without a man. According to the "Antislavery Connection," they learned how to "write persuasively, raise funds, organize supporters and events‚Äù to maintain jobs, get funding approved, and organize war efforts <a href="https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/antislavery-connection.htm" style="color: #DCE2DF" target="_blank">("Antislavery Connection")</a>. The economy didn't collapse as America fought against itself; it held sturdy thanks to women who stayed home. </p1></li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Losses &amp; Widows: </b><p1> Many women lost their fathers, husbands, brothers, and sons. While they aided in abolishing slavery and supporting the economy, they had to deal with the losses of their families and friends. Those who fought in the war, boosted the economy, and fought for rights lost their lives as well. They lost people, status, and property but were given no compensation in return, not even a place in American history books.</p1></li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Women's Rights: </b><p1> The "Antislavery Connection" notes that the anti-slavery movement had encouraged a fight for women's rights <a href="https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/antislavery-connection.htm" style="color: #DCE2DF" target="_blank">("Antislavery Connection")</a>. No matter the color of their skin, all women were barred from the abolition movement, which caused for a rise in their gender rights. They collectively argued for voting rights, jobs rights, and financial rights. </p1></li>
